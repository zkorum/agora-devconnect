# Collective Sense-Making at Devconnect 2025 🌎


### **💡 How does it work?**

[Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/) is using [**Agora**](https://agoracitizen.network), an open-source deliberation platform, to capture and make sense of the ecosystem’s diverse opinions. By joining the conversations, you can 

- **Participate anonymously** by verifying your DevConnect Ticket via Zupass
- **Share your voice** by voting agree/disagree/unsure on other people’s opinions or add your own
- **Visualize opinions** and see where people align or diverge
- **Build stronger communities** through transparent, data-driven dialogues
